수호천사 (Chunsabot)
==================

***This readme.md is not yet completed.***

Bot framework for messenger just for playing :)

This framework can be attached to many different bot implementation.

Official facebook page : http://fb.com/chunsab

Chunsabot is written in Python.

(Tested in Python 3, I recently migrated it from Python 2 to Python 3, so I don't guarantee that Python 2 will work).

How to use (Normal user - Korean)
--------

수호천사는 봇 구현체가 아닌 하나의 프레임워크입니다. 하지만, 테스트와 재미를 위해서 텔레그램을 위한 봇 구현체가 구현되어 있습니다. 일반 사용자를 이를 이용해서 텔레그램에서 봇을 운영할 수 있습니다.

* telegram-cli는 비동기 메시지 전송을 지원하지 않습니다. 따라서, 메시지가 오면 그 메시지에 대한 처리를 하는 동기 방식을 사용하고 있습니다. 이는 많은 메시지가 동시에 올 경우 봇을 불안정하게 만들 수 있습니다.


How to use (Normal user)
--------

Despite Chunsabot is not a bot implementation but a framework, I made a bot implementation which works in Telegram.
In other words, a user can run a bot via Telegram.

* telegram-cli does not support async message sending, so I wrote it using synchronous procedure. This behavior would make bot unstable when a lot of messages are arriving at the same time.

How to do:

1. Install Python 3. (I tested it using Python 3.4.3 and OS X 10.10)
2. Install dependencies by running command.
```
pip install -r pip.dependencies
```
3. Run following command to make initial config.
```
python3 /path/to/your/framework/bot.py --make-initial-config
```
4. Run telegram-cli with bot script by using following command.
```
./telegram-cli -Z /path/to/your/framework/bot.py
```

You can learn how to play with bot by typing "." command. :)

How to use (Bot Developer)
--------------------

Chunsabot supports both synchronous and asynchronous logic.

You can make a bot implementation via modifying bot.py. Doing this, you can make a bot implementation using LINE, Facebook Messenger or even KakaoTalk. (up to you)

- How to make bot implementation

1. Delete bot.py
2. Write "Your" bot.py by following these rules.

```
TBA
```
3.

Adding new modules (Bot Developer)
--------------------------------------------

Chunsabot's Botlogic uses routing system to process different modules.

You can create new python file to `modules` directory and write the bot logic script.

Below is an example code.

```python

from chunsabot.botlogic import brain
from chunsabot.messages import ResultMessage
import random
import re

@brain.route('Hello')
def hello(msg, extras):
    resp = u"Hello {0}!".format(extras['user_name'])
    return ResultMessage(resp)

@brain.startswith('테스트')
def test(msg, extras):
    return "{0}\n\n{1}".format(msg.__repr__(), extras.__repr__())

@brain.startswith('선택')
def choice(msg, extras):
    msg = msg.split(',')

    if len(msg) == 1:
        return ResultMessage(".선택 사과, 딸기, 포도")

    for m in msg:
        m = m.strip()

    choiced = msg[random.randint(0, len(msg) - 1)]

    return ResultMessage("{0}님이 제시한 것들 중 {1}을(를) 골랐습니다.".format(extras['user_name'], choiced))

@brain.route(['나', '너', '우리'])
def youandi(cmd, msg, extras):
    return ResultMessage("[나, 너, 우리]\n{0}".format(cmd))

@brain.route(re.compile('^\d+$'))
def number(cmd, msg, extras):
    return ResultMessage("숫자입니다.")

```

* The decorator, brain.route or brain.startswith, can accept a type : list, str, regex type.

* you can pass a parameter below to the decorator.

|        kwargs        |                   description                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|       no_params      |          don't provide a parameter to the function.        |
| disable_when_silence | the function won't work when the bot is in "Silence Mode". |  


Remark
------
- All strings are processed as unicode. Though there are a logic that converts type(str) to type(unicode), all responses should be given as unicode. <- Don't need to do it since Chunsabot now uses Python 3.

- *Mafiagame (mafia.py) and SharedScheduler (schedule.py) is not yet fully implemented and tested.*

- Some modules are not yet tested after the migration. (such as weather.py)

- ~~verify_url.py is a module which verifies a given URL is whether spam or not. Since the API is now broken (Note, Chunsabot is originally deployed 1 year ago), it won't work.~~
it is now deprecated.


####Editing config.yaml file

*We don't have to create config.py but configmaker does it for you.*

|   keys for config   | type |   description                                                        |

|  debug_mode         | bool |  Switch for "debug mode".                                            |
|  debug_users        | list |  Collection of users allowing "debug command". (starts with @)       |
|  leave              | str  |  Keyword for force bot to leave the room. (Telegram unsupported)     |
|  sensitive_map      | list |  Collection of words which should be applied only in the room where executed the learn command. |
|  weather_url_all    | str  |  KMA Weather API URL                                                 |
|  google_api_key     | str  |  Google API Key for searching images and YouTube.                    |

####Extras (passed to botlogic with msg)

|    key     |  type   | description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
|  room_id   | long    | Unique identifier of room.        |
|  user_id   | int     | Unique identifier of person.      |
